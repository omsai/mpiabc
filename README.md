# Getting started

## Installation

Install `spack` and the MPI-ABC dependencies into a new spack environment
called "mpi-abc":

```
git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git
cd spack
source share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack compiler find
spack env create mpi-abc
spack env activate mpi-abc
spack add mpich
spack add gsl+external-cblas
spack add dmtcp
spack add doxygen
spack install
```

Then run `ninja` to build both the executable `model` and this PDF
documentation `latex/refman.pdf`:

```
python3 -m pip install --user ninja
ninja
```

## Usage

Run the `model` generated by `ninja` with:

```
./model
```
